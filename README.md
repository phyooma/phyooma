# BYI

I am a dry texter and always end my messages with a period, but that doesn't mean I automatically hate you and all, I just type like that whenever I feel shy or pissed.
(And yes I do type in all caps and without period in the end. It's just an common occurrence if I fw you platonically, or I actually admire you respecrfully.)

I do get very, I mean **VERY** comfortable when I'm talking to you, and it'll result our conversation into NSFW and stuff. If you're uncomfortable with it, immediately tell right away.

I do not have a dni, but if you're being weird at the point I feel icky, I would immediately confront you, and won't hesitate blocking you if you're either stubborn or straight up dumb.

I tend to go aggressive towards anyone sometimes, but it only happens if I'm not in a mood and about to lose my shit.
